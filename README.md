Ceiling Fan:

This is a simple Java program that models a ceiling fan with two pull cords. The program provides the following features:

-One cord increases the speed each time it is pulled. There are 3 speed settings, and an "off" (speed 0) setting. If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the "off" setting.

-One cord reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting. Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.

The ceiling fan should be "off" on December 25th all day even if the cords are pulled.

The program is implemented in Java, and uses object-oriented programming principles.

Usage:

To use this program, you can run the CeilingFan class, which provides a main method that demonstrates the basic features of the ceiling fan. You can customize the code to create your own ceiling fan object, pull the cords as desired, and print the current state of the fan using the toString method.
